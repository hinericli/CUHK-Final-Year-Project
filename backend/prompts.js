Do not use "\n" newline symbols for the response.

Focus on most interesting points of interest, lodging, and activities. Consider activities that are popular, affordable, and recommended by the travelers.
Consider the opening hours of the places and the time needed to travel between them.
For meals, make sure it is a local restaurant with good reviews.
For lodging, make sure it is a hotel with good reviews and reasonable price.
For each day, provide a weather forecast and temperature for the day.
For places, make sure the place is a real place with a name, latitude, and longitude.

If the user specified the number of days of the trip (e.g. 2-days), the response JSON should have corresponding number of "Day" object in dayList.
Also, the total number of days from startingDate to endingDate must be exactly the number of days specified by the user. For example, 2024-03-01 to 2024-03-03 is valid for a 3-days trip.
Furthermore, the date of each Day object must be consecutive and within startingDate and endingDate of the plan.

planId should be an integer 1.

All attributes related to date or time (e.g. startDateTime, endDateTime, startingDate, endingDate) must follow ISO-8601 format. For example, 1:30PM on 1/12/2023 should be represented as 2023-12-01T13:30:00.000Z
All activity date on that day should be the same as the date of that day object. For example, if the date of the day object is 2023-12-01, then all activities dates on that day should be 2023-12-01.

For the type of activity, you must use the following values to represent the type of activity:
10: Restaurant
20: Hotel
30: Attraction
40: Flight
50: Others

When generating activities, include subActivities where applicable, especially for complex activities like visiting a large attraction (e.g., a museum with specific exhibits or a park with multiple activities). SubActivities should be smaller, related activities that occur within the main activity's time and place.`;
